"""Send a stream of pitch, yaw, roll values to other devices on a multipeer network.
Uses Pythonista's motion.get_attitude() to get data and @mikaelho's multipeer to send.
Install multipeer on two iOS devices and run this code on one and multipeer.py on the
other.  You should see a stream of attitude data which change as the device is moved.

TODO (cclauss): Upgrade to multipeer streams in latency becomes an issue.
