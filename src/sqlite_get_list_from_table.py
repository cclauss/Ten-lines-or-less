"""Useful tools for reading sqlite database tables into Python data structures.
Each row of your database table is converted into a namedtuple with fieldnames
taken from the sqlite table definition.  Using the namedtuple._asdict() method
allows you to use treat each table as a list of dicts or if your table has a
primary key which is unique for each row in the table, as a dict of dicts.

get_list_from_table() + get_dict_from_table() is 12 lines because of the
useful uniqueness test in the dict routine and because doing camelize()
inline would make the code too difficult to understand.
